# Fintext\_NLP

**Fintext\_NLP** is a collection of applied projects exploring natural language processing in financial contexts. The goal is to evaluate how transformer-based models can be adapted, fine-tuned, or extended for tasks like sentiment analysis, domain adaptation, and transfer learningâ€”specifically within the language of markets, news, and financial commentary.

Projects are modular, experiment-driven, and focused on bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and domain-specific performance in finance.
